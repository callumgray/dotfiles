dotfiles
========

dryas dotfiles. Clone, cd into clone directory and do `./symlink.sh` to symlink them all into `$HOME`.

`.zshrc` assumes [oh-my-zsh](robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) is installed.
`.vimrc` assumes [vim-plug](junegunn/vim-plug)is installed; just run `:PlugInstall` once that's done.
`.gnuplot` benefits from cloning [gnuplot-palettes](Gnuplotting/gnuplot-palettes) to `~/.config/gnuplot` to make various preset colour schemes available.
